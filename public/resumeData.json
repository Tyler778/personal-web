    "bio":"After years of deliberating if I was smart enough to really try programming, I finally started realizing that nobody's great the first day.  We all struggle learning this ever evolving field, and the struggle is where growth happens.  I have enjoyed the 'Aha!' moments along the way, and in a weird way, even the mind-numbing bugs have their place in my heart.  Outside of software, I love spending time in the outdoors with friends either hiking, camping, climbing, or skiing, and as a Cincinnati native, Who Dey!",
